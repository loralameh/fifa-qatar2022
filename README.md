# fifa-qatar2022
Project Proposal
World Cup is at the door and everyone is so excited about it. People want to find a perfect seat in the stadium to cheer their favorite team in the game, but due to busy schedules it is hard for them to do so physically especially if they have to travel for long distances to book it. 

Also, Due to the time difference some people may not have the ability to watch the game if they are working, sleeping or having time conflicts with their responsibilities.

 On the other hand, some people have the vision and ability to read and analyze teams’ performance therefore they might predict a close result of certain game, however, they don’t benefit anything from it.
“World Cup 2022” is a platform that organizes buying tickets and makes football lovers’ life easier by providing them a quick access to book a seat for them or even gift it for their friends! They can view all the details about a certain game (participating teams, game time, place…) also they can predict results for every game and win coins if they get a correct guess so they are involved in every single event in the world cup!

User Part:

3.	It allows the users to view the games predictions.
4.	The users will have the ability to know the date of the games to be played.
5.	The users will have the ability to reserve seats in the stadium.
